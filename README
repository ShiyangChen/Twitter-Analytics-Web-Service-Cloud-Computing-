This is the final project of the course Cloud Computing which is decided into 3 phases. Out team(3 members) spent about 2 months to implement it. The phase 3 is the final part, which includes phase 2 and phase 1. 

What we have done:
- Extracted and transformed 1TB Twitter raw data by MapReduce of Amazon Web Service (AWS); loaded them to database by Hadoop and MySQL commands; Implemented 6 queries on 2 different databases.
- Designed schemas and optimized efficiency of each query in MySQL and HBase. Then compared     performances (throughput) of these 2 databases and select one to compete against other teams.
- Front end: Configured Tomcat and Java Servlet on EC2 with ELB as load balancer to allocate duties.


Detailed implementation can be viewed in the inside README.
